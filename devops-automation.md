Easy to Get Started
===================

- Minimal prerequisites for (local) development
- One command to take off, avoid custom solutions + tools
- Fully automated deployment, fully scripted one-off setup


```console
# fast, well-known patterns for local development, e.g.
docker-compose up
```

```console
# semi-automation (instead of manual setup instructions), e.g.
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
