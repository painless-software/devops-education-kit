Dev(Sec)Ops Education Kit
=========================

> Modern software development is safe and fast, reproducible and automatic. Cloud-native, resilient and scalable.

[Easy to Get Started](devops-automation.md)
---------------------

*Full automation, everything in code. End to end, for humans and machines.*

[Branching + Development](devops-branching.md)
-------------------------

*Simple. Use branching to ensure only working code is merged. Don't use it to control feature releases.*

[Environments + Deployment](devops-environments.md)
---------------------------

*Deploy every single, working feature directly. Stop using sprint reviews for release decisions. Give your PO control over feature flags.*

[Continuous Delivery](cicd-mindmap.md)
---------------------

*A set of practices and principles in software engineering aimed at building, testing, and releasing software safely, faster, more frequently, and in a sustainable way.*
